# Web Scraping Project using Selenium and BeautifulSoup

## Project Overview

This project involves web scraping using Selenium and BeautifulSoup, two powerful tools for extracting data from websites. Selenium is used to automate web browsers, particularly useful for interacting with dynamic content, while BeautifulSoup provides a more straightforward approach for parsing and extracting data from static HTML. This README provides an overview of the project, setup instructions, and details on how web scraping was implemented using both tools.

## Features

- **Automated Data Extraction with Selenium:** Automates web page interaction, including clicking buttons, filling out forms, and scrolling, to extract data from websites, especially those that dynamically load content with JavaScript.
- **HTML Parsing with BeautifulSoup:** Efficiently parses HTML content to extract specific data from static pages or after Selenium has loaded dynamic content.
- **Combining Tools for Flexibility:** The combination of Selenium and BeautifulSoup allows for handling both dynamic and static content scraping, offering flexibility in dealing with a wide range of websites.
- **Customizable Scraping Workflow:** The scraping script can be easily adapted to target different websites or specific elements on a page.
- **Error Handling:** Includes basic error handling for scenarios like page load failures, missing elements, or timeouts.
- **Data Storage:** Extracted data can be stored in various formats, including CSV, JSON, or directly into a database.

## Requirements

- **Python:** Ensure Python is installed on your system.
- **Selenium:** Required for web automation and interacting with dynamic content.
- **BeautifulSoup:** Used for parsing HTML content.
- **WebDriver:** Download the appropriate WebDriver for the browser you intend to use (e.g., ChromeDriver for Google Chrome).

### Python Libraries

Make sure to install the following Python libraries:

```bash
pip install selenium beautifulsoup4 requests
